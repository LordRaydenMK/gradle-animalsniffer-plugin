 * it could be an issue. Cache intended to solve this problem by building special signature from configured signature
 * and project classpath. First check run will be slower (time to build signature file), but subsequent runs will
 * be very fast.
 * <p>
 * Disabled by default due to known issues, when project specific signature could not be build (signature and jars
 * conflict).
